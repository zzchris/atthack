# Production Problem 6: HTML De-Linting and Validation

## The Problem

Using the HTML Tidy tool, installed as a command-line tool on your computer via instructions at http://www.html-tidy.org, and the HTML validator at http://validator.w3.org, rework the HTML file in this directory (`index.html`) so that is free from errors.

## Resources

* HTML Tidy: http://www.html-tidy.org/
* HTML Validator: http://validator.w3.org/

## Deliverables

1. First, run HTML Tidy on the index.html file. Copy and paste the errors here:


line 6 column 5 - Warning: <meta> unexpected or duplicate quote mark
line 10 column 46 - Warning: <img> attribute with missing trailing quote mark
line 10 column 7 - Warning: missing </a>
Info: Document content looks like HTML5
3 warnings, 0 errors were found!

2. Fix as many errors as are listed by HTML Tidy, and re-run until there are no errors reported. HINT: Always fix the first error reported, then re-run tidy. Then, run the contents of `index.html` through the HTML validator. List any errors that the validator reports here:

Error: = in an unquoted attribute value. Probable causes: Attributes running together or a URL query string in an unquoted attribute value.
At line 6, column 40
" content=width=device-width,i

Error: = in an unquoted attribute value. Probable causes: Attributes running together or a URL query string in an unquoted attribute value.
At line 6, column 67

Error: = in an unquoted attribute value. Probable causes: Attributes running together or a URL query string in an unquoted attribute value.
At line 6, column 85
0,shrink-to-fit=no/>? <link

Error: Text not allowed in element figure in this context.
From line 11, column 57; to line 14, column 4
igcaption>?        Hank and Fanny are having the time of their lives (well, Hank is) on New?        Year’s Eve, 2016.?    </figu
Content model for element figure:
Either: One figcaption element followed by flow content.
Or: Flow content followed by one figcaption element.

Error: The aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document.
From line 9, column 5; to line 9, column 79
body>? <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="hank-and-fanny" class="hank-and-fanny">?     	


3. Finally, fix the errors that are listed by the HTML validator, and commit the `index.html` file in its error-free state.

4. Bonus: What error remained that neither Tidy nor the validator did not catch? Fix it, if you've not already, and mark as its own commit.
