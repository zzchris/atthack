# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
Desktop
Once the user is signed in, the website has too many sponsored ads that make it confusing and hard to find what the user wants. Too many "top picks for you", "Inspired by shopping trend" and "recommendations for you".
Top banner is too commercial, I would remove it and all these recommendations.

HTML/CSS/Javascript
I would remove top banner and all these recommendations in order to have more white space. This shows transparency, and the customers wouldn't feel like they are tricked or brainwashed into buying more products from Amazon. Less confusion, and more clear navigation to satisfy customer's needs.
