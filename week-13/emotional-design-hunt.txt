# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Simple and black porcelan design. There is a sense of mystery to what kind of tea you will be drinking. Asian descent. Used to make green tea. 

* Behavioral: Bamboo handle is soft on the hands. Thick structure to keep tea warm. Rounded teapot to store high-volume tea. 

* Reflective: Teapot shows asian qualities (bamboo, small round teapots...) typically used for making green tea. Great depth in history usually in East Asia. Feeling relaxed, calm and thought-provoking experiences. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Black exterior and white interior highlights the simplicity of its design. Even with only 2 colors, you can still make an object user-friendly and functioning at the same time without distrating anybody.
2. Highly functioning as the grip feels soft but still practical. Bamboo handle reflects the culture and at the same time its easy to use. Everybody would know how to pour the tea.
3. Makes the user feel relaxed and calm. No features would distract the person from sipping tea.
